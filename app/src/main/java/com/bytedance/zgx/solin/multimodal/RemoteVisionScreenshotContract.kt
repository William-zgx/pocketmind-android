/**
 * Boundary invariants for the opt-in remote-vision GUI automation screenshot path.
 *
 * This is the deliberate inverse of [CurrentScreenshotOcrContract]: where the OCR contract
 * fails closed on pixels ever leaving the device, this path — gated behind the
 * `remoteGuiAutomationEnabled` opt-in and a first-confirm gate — transmits transient JPEG pixels to
 * a remote vision model so it can "see" the current screen and decide a tap. The two contracts must
 * never be confused: the OCR capture stays LocalOnly with pixels recycled on-device; this capture
 * crosses the remote boundary.
 *
 * Capture mechanism: the already-connected [android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService]'s
 * `takeScreenshot` (API 30+) — NOT MediaProjection. There is no per-capture system screen-cast
 * dialog and no foreground service; screen-pixel egress consent is governed entirely by the in-app
 * opt-in toggle plus the run's first-confirm gate.
 *
 * Invariants enforced here (parallel to the OCR boundary, inverted where the meaning flips):
 * - [requiresRemoteVisionOptIn]: capture only runs when the user enabled remote GUI automation.
 * - [inAppScreenEgressConsentRequired]: screen-pixel egress is gated by the in-app opt-in + the
 *   run's first-confirm gate (not by any per-capture OS consent dialog).
 * - [firstSendConfirmationRequired]: the first remote send of a run is user-confirmed; sensitive
 *   content and dangerous taps stay confirmed on every send even within an authorized continuation.
 * - [crossesRemoteBoundary]: pixels ARE transmitted (the point of the feature) — must be true.
 * - [persistsPixels]: pixels must NEVER be persisted; bytes are transient and dropped after send.
 * - [producesSemanticVisualUnderstanding]: the remote model DOES produce visual semantics — must
 *   be true (this is exactly what the OCR contract forbids).
 * - [tapsExecutedLocally]: the model's decision is an untrusted suggestion; taps run locally
 *   through the unchanged device-control executor with all preflights (dangerous/foreground).

# Privacy Notice

This notice describes the privacy boundary implemented by PocketMind for Android
release candidates. Public distribution still requires release, security, and
legal approval for the current app behavior, support process, and publication
channel.

## Local Storage

PocketMind is local-first by default. The app stores chat sessions, chat
messages, model registry state, download records, scheduled background tasks,
explicit long-term memory records, Agent trace summaries, pending confirmation
snapshots, Skill checkpoints, and tool audit metadata in local Android app
storage. These records are not a cloud sync source in this codebase.

Local records may include user-entered chat text and assistant responses.
Privacy-sensitive generated or tool-derived content is marked `LocalOnly` where
the code can identify it. Examples include clipboard-derived messages,
shared-input excerpts, OCR excerpts, current-screen Accessibility text
continuations, local memory-control status turns, and local action turns.
If a chat-message row is inserted without an explicit privacy value, the local
database defaults that row to `LocalOnly`.

Remote API keys are stored separately through Android Keystore-backed encrypted
preferences. Clearing the API key field removes the stored secret.

## Remote Model Mode

Remote model mode sends requests only to the user-configured OpenAI-compatible
chat endpoint. The request can include the current user prompt, selected model
name, generation parameters, and prior chat messages whose privacy is
`RemoteEligible`.

The app filters `LocalOnly` messages from remote history and rejects a
`LocalOnly` current prompt before making a remote request. Local memory hits,
device context, clipboard content, OCR text, current-screen Accessibility text,
shared-input excerpts, attachment metadata, and local action draft turns are
not automatically sent to a remote model. If the user manually types or pastes
the same content into a normal remote-eligible message, that message can be
sent.

When the user explicitly sends images to a configured remote vision model, the
image bytes are attached to that request, but the text prompt uses only a
generic image count and support notice. It does not include attachment display
names, MIME types, byte sizes, OCR text, or non-image attachment metadata.

Remote transport requires HTTPS, except for local debug hosts such as
`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and Android emulator `10.0.2.2`. When an API key is
configured, the runtime sends it as an authorization credential to the
configured endpoint. The endpoint operator's own logging and retention policies
apply.

Remote model tool requests are not executed by the remote endpoint. The app
parses OpenAI-compatible `tool_calls` locally and revalidates every request
through the Tool Registry, safety policy, Agent trace, and audit path before
execution. Remote mode exposes a model-planning tool schema set that can include
public search plus non-private draft, navigation, sharing, or local
reminder-style tools, but those non-public tools still require local
confirmation and are not executed by the remote model. Local evidence tools
that read clipboard, contacts, calendar, files, notifications, screen text, OCR,
or other private context are not exposed to remote planning. A single public
read-only evidence tool such as `web_search` may run without confirmation for
public queries; queries that appear to contain personal data or secrets require
confirmation before network access. Multiple tool calls in one remote model turn may run
concurrently only when every requested tool is `PublicEvidence`,
`LowReadOnly`, `NotRequired`, has no private output keys, and declares no
device-context, Android permission, MediaProjection, external-navigation,
sharing, scheduling, notification, or other side-effect permission. Mixed
batches are rejected as a whole before any tool runs, so a safe public lookup
is not executed beside a private local read or action tool. A public evidence
result can return to the remote model only when it explicitly declares
`privacy=RemoteEligible` and `requiresLocalModel=false`; missing or local-only
metadata fails closed before remote continuation.

## Device Context Tools

Device context tools are gated behind Agent planning, schema validation, safety
policy, and user confirmation. The current tool set includes bounded reads for
clipboard text, calendar busy/free windows, contact name/phone search, current
foreground app metadata, current-app notification metadata, recent file
metadata, recent screenshot/image OCR excerpts, and current-screen
Accessibility text snapshots.

These tools are designed to minimize returned data. For example, recent file
reads return metadata rather than file contents, paths, or URIs; current-screen
text reads use Accessibility text nodes rather than screenshots or pixels; OCR
tools avoid persisting image identifiers, paths, raw pixels, and raw OCR text in
trace or audit stores. Foreground-app reads are labeled as UsageStats
estimates, and Android 14+ selected-photo grants are labeled as user-selected
visual media rather than full-library access. Clipboard text, contact matches,
calendar busy/free windows, foreground-app metadata, current-app notification
summaries, recent file metadata, OCR excerpts, and current-screen
Accessibility snapshots are marked `LocalOnly` and `requiresLocalModel=true`;
their local payload fields are
declared as private tool outputs so they remain inside local continuation,
observation, trace-redaction, and Skill public-output boundaries.

Android runtime permissions and special app access are requested only after the
user confirms the associated tool request. Permission denial is treated as a
structured tool failure rather than an automatic retry.
On Android 13 and above, `query_recent_files` does not expose a direct
`documents`, `downloads`, or `others` query path; non-media files must be
provided through the system file picker or Android share input.
Special-access flows are disclosed separately from runtime permissions:
Usage Access is used only for confirmed foreground-app estimates,
Accessibility is used only for confirmed current-screen text reads, and
MediaProjection is used only for one-shot current-screen screenshot OCR after
foreground consent.

## External Intents And Sharing

Confirmed tools may open Android system screens, the share sheet, email drafts,
calendar drafts, contact drafts, web links, app launchers, or allowlisted app
settings pages. Once an external screen opens, the destination app or Android
system component may receive the prefilled data needed for that action. The
current app records this as an opened-but-unverified boundary; it cannot know
whether the user completed the destination app action.

System speech recognition inserts a transcript into the compose box only.
Sending remains explicit. Audio/video/legacy Office/binary attachments are
metadata-only in the current app; supported strict UTF-8 text, RTF, PDF text
layers, PDF scanned-page OCR fallback, and Office Open XML attachments may
produce bounded local excerpts. User-provided image attachments are not
automatically OCRed or visually read unless they are sent to a supported remote
vision model; explicit confirmed OCR tools remain separate. Malformed PDFs remain
metadata-only. If Android does not provide a useful MIME type for a
user-provided attachment, PocketMind may infer common supported types from the
display-name extension before deciding whether a bounded local excerpt is
possible. Shared-input excerpts are staged as local composer drafts and are not
sent to local generation until the user taps send. LocalOnly conversation text
is not indexed for automatic memory recall. Automatic conversation recall is
rebuilt only from user messages; assistant responses are not indexed as
conversation recall. LocalOnly user text is not used verbatim for session-list
titles. This inference does not make shared-input excerpts remote-eligible.

## Model Downloads

Recommended model downloads use Android `DownloadManager` and contact the
configured upstream download URLs. Recommended downloads are registered only
after SHA-256 verification against the pinned model manifest. Custom imported
models and custom URL downloads are user-supplied and are not covered by the
recommended-model provenance guarantees.

The recommended local chat path currently starts with the E2B model, which is a
multi-GB download. Users can instead configure a remote model endpoint or import
a trusted compatible `.litertlm` file. The smaller memory and action model
assets are not replacements for a chat model.

Model files are stored in local app storage and are not bundled into the APK.
Network operators and model hosts may receive normal download metadata such as
IP address, URL, user agent, timing, and download size.

## Audit And Trace Data

Tool audit events store metadata such as event time, event type, tool name,
status, risk level, permission names, and sanitized summaries. They are
intentionally not a full prompt or tool-argument log. The app prunes the
Room-backed audit table after writes and keeps only the most recent 500 audit
events.

Agent trace and pending confirmation recovery are intentionally narrower than a
full execution replay. Pending rows persist only allowlisted request arguments,
redacted structure, and value-free checkpoint identifiers where possible.
Payload-bearing confirmations, including Skill pending arguments bound from
earlier outputs but not pending-allowlisted, fail closed after restart instead
of restoring private executable payload values or incomplete confirmations.

## Retention And Controls

Users can create, switch, and delete chat sessions in the app. Long-term memory
supports reviewing explicit records, forgetting individual records, and
clearing explicit memory records. Clearing app data or uninstalling the app
removes local app storage according to Android platform behavior.
When local memory is disabled, explicit remember/fact commands do not create
new long-term memory records; forget and clear controls can still remove
existing records.

This codebase does not contain a first-party analytics upload path beyond
user-configured remote model calls, recommended/custom model downloads, and
Android external intents initiated by confirmed actions. Recheck release builds
and any added SDKs before publishing this statement externally.

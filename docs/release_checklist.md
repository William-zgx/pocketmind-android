# Production Release Checklist

Use this checklist for each release candidate. It is intentionally operational:
every checked item should have a named owner, date, and artifact link in the
release ticket or PR.

## Scope

- [ ] Release version name and version code are final.
- [ ] Release branch, commit SHA, and changelog are recorded.
- [ ] Release owner, reviewer, date, and target channel are recorded.
- [ ] APK/AAB artifact path, SHA-256, signing certificate fingerprint, and
  verification evidence links are recorded.
- [ ] Open blockers are either resolved or explicitly accepted by the release
  owner with a dated risk note, evidence file, and matching SHA-256.
- [ ] Target audience is clear: internal testing, closed testing, or broader
  distribution.
- [ ] Known unsupported capabilities are called out, especially screenshot
  capture, semantic screen understanding, full PDF parsing, legacy Office
  parsing, local image semantic understanding without a configured remote
  vision model, and arbitrary media OCR.
- [ ] Agent/tool behavior changes are summarized, including remote
  OpenAI-style `tool_calls`, public evidence batch execution, all-or-nothing
  mixed-batch rejection, and the privacy boundary for LocalOnly tool results.
- [ ] `docs/release_record.json` is updated for the release candidate and
  `VERIFY_RELEASE_RECORD=1 scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` passes. The gate
  checks the recorded Gradle version, current HEAD Git commit, artifact
  checksum, signing certificate fingerprint, `status=passed` verification evidence files,
  unsupported capabilities, Agent behavior summary, and resolved or accepted
  blockers with matching evidence SHA-256. For `PUBLIC_RELEASE=1`, the record
  must use a public distribution channel and match the final AAB path, artifact
  SHA-256, and production signing certificate SHA-256 passed to the release
  gate; it also requires a clean Git worktree unless `ALLOW_DIRTY_RELEASE=1` is
  explicitly set for non-production dry-run validation.

## Versioning And Release Track

- [ ] Current Gradle values are recorded:
  `applicationId=com.bytedance.zgx.pocketmind`, `minSdk=28`, `targetSdk=36`,
  current `versionCode=1`, and current `versionName=0.1.0`.
- [ ] `versionCode` is strictly higher than every artifact ever uploaded to the
  same Play application; never reuse a version code, even for a rejected build.
- [ ] `versionName` follows the user-visible release train, for example
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for public releases and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N` only
  for internal/closed testing when the channel allows it.
- [ ] Release notes map version name, version code, Git SHA, artifact checksum,
  and target track: internal, closed, open, staged production, or full
  production.
- [ ] Upgrade paths from the previous production version and the latest internal
  test version are installed and smoke-tested. Downgrade is either tested or
  explicitly unsupported because Room migrations are forward-only.

## Signing, AAB, And Play App Signing

- [ ] Local debug builds are clearly separated from release artifacts:
  `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` and the Android debug keystore are only for
  developer/device checks and are never uploaded, distributed, or used as
  production evidence.
- [ ] Release signing material is provided outside source control. The release
  record names the signing owner, keystore custody location, upload key alias,
  certificate SHA-256 fingerprint, and recovery contact.
- [ ] `scripts/sign_release_artifacts.sh` is run from the private signing
  environment with `RELEASE_KEYSTORE`, `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`,
  `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`, and
  `EXPECTED_SIGNING_CERT_SHA256`; attach
  `build/verification/signing/signing.properties` and the certificate reports.
  Failed signing attempts must record `failedTarget` and `reason` without
  persisting keystore passwords or private key material. `ALLOW_DEBUG_KEYSTORE`
  must be unset for production signing.
- [ ] For Google Play, Play App Signing is enabled or its status is explicitly
  recorded. The app signing certificate fingerprint and upload certificate
  fingerprint are both captured because they are different trust anchors.
- [ ] The Play candidate is an Android App Bundle built with release settings:
  `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease`. Record
  `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` before signing and
  `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release-signed.aab` after external
  signing, including SHA-256, file size, and signing certificate fingerprint.
- [ ] If an APK is used for internal ad hoc validation, it is separately signed
  outside source control, labeled as non-Play evidence, and not confused with
  the Play AAB.
- [ ] APK/AAB inspection confirms no `.litertlm` model binaries, API keys,
  bearer tokens, private hostnames, or release keystore files are bundled, and
  the artifact is a readable APK/AAB with the expected manifest structure.
- [ ] `scripts/scan_android_artifacts.sh` is run against the final APK/AAB and
  `android-artifact-scan.properties` is attached to the release record.
- [ ] `android-artifact-scan.properties` records a machine-readable `reason`
  list whenever artifact scanning fails.
- [ ] Release artifact size is within the documented budget, and model files are
  described as optional/recommended downloads rather than packaged assets.

## Store Metadata And Policy

- [ ] App name, short description, full description, category, and contact
  email are reviewed.
- [ ] Privacy policy or privacy notice URL points to the approved external
  version of `docs/privacy_notice.md`.
- [ ] Google Play Data safety answers match the implemented behavior for local
  Room/DataStore storage, encrypted remote API keys, user-configured remote
  model calls, recommended/custom model downloads, Android permissions,
  external intents, and the absence of first-party analytics upload in this
  codebase.
- [ ] The Data safety form records whether data is collected, shared, encrypted
  in transit, user-deletable, optional, and purpose-limited. Treat user-chosen
  remote model endpoints and model hosts as external recipients where their own
  policies apply.
- [ ] Model downloads are described as large optional/recommended assets and
  not as APK-bundled files.
- [ ] Required Android permissions and special-access flows are explained in
  user-facing language.
- [ ] Sensitive permission disclosures are complete for `RECORD_AUDIO`,
  `READ_CALENDAR`, `READ_CONTACTS`, legacy `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`,
  `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`,
  `READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`,
  `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`, the Accessibility service, and one-shot
  MediaProjection consent for current-screen OCR.
- [ ] Play declarations or review notes explain why Usage Access,
  Accessibility, notifications, calendar/contact reads, media reads, voice
  input, document/share input, external navigation, and reminders are requested
  only for user-confirmed flows.
- [ ] `docs/store_policy_record.json` is updated and approved, then
  `VERIFY_STORE_POLICY=1 scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` passes. The gate
  checks store listing fields, privacy policy URL, Data safety answers, model
  download disclosure, manifest permission purposes, special-access
  disclosures, the current privacy notice SHA, and a review evidence file with
  matching SHA-256.

## Screenshots

- [ ] Chat home screen screenshot uses non-sensitive sample text.
- [ ] Model manager screenshot shows local/remote model controls without API
  keys or private endpoints.
- [ ] Confirmation sheet screenshot shows an example low-risk tool request.
- [ ] Background tasks or audit screenshot uses synthetic task names and
  redacted metadata.
- [ ] Screenshots do not include real contacts, notifications, clipboard text,
  current-screen text, API keys, emails, phone numbers, or internal hostnames.
- [ ] Every screenshot attached to release validation is listed in
  `docs/release_validation_record.json` with its sanitized flag, matching
  screenshot SHA-256, and a matching `release-screenshots.properties` report
  path/SHA-256. Each linked screenshot file must be PNG evidence captured by
  `scripts/capture_release_screenshots.sh`; text or placeholder files are not
  accepted.
- [ ] Every screenshot report includes the matching UI dump path/SHA-256,
  `visualRegression=passed`, and the expected `requiredText` contract for that
  release screen. The release validation verifier must reject screenshots whose
  UI dump does not contain the expected visible text for chat home, model
  manager, confirmation, and background/audit screens.

## Privacy And License

- [ ] `docs/privacy_notice.md` is reviewed by release, security, and legal
  owners before publication. Record the approved current notice SHA in
  `docs/privacy_review.json`; every role approval must include an evidence file
  path and matching SHA-256. Then run `VERIFY_PRIVACY_REVIEW=1
  scripts/verify_release_gate.sh`.
- [ ] All four recommended model downloads in `docs/model_manifest.md` have
  manually verified manifest repository, pinned upstream revision, license
  name, license source URL or file path, redistribution decision, attribution
  or notice requirements, reviewer, review date, review evidence file path, and
  matching review evidence SHA-256. For Hugging Face-hosted models, the license
  source must point to a concrete license, notice, terms, or model-card file
  such as a `blob`, `raw`, or `resolve` URL; the repository homepage is not
  acceptable as a license source.
- [ ] `scripts/collect_model_license_metadata.sh` is run with `REPORT_FILE`
  before manual model review. Attach the collector report and confirm
  `docs/model_license_metadata.json` includes `licenseSourceCandidates` for
  Hugging Face-hosted models. These candidates are reviewer input only; they do
  not approve redistribution and do not replace the concrete license source
  recorded in `docs/model_license_review.json`.
- [ ] `docs/model_license_review.json` is updated from pending to approved
  records before broad distribution, and `VERIFY_MODEL_LICENSES=1
  scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` passes for the release candidate. The gate
  runs `scripts/verify_model_license_review.sh`, requiring all model IDs,
  repositories, and pinned upstream revisions to match `docs/model_manifest.md`,
  metadata to match that manifest, and approvals to include aligned license
  names, approved redistribution, attribution or notice, reviewer, and a valid
  concrete license source plus a non-future review date not older than the
  metadata collection date, with review evidence bound by SHA-256.
- [ ] README License wording distinguishes app code from third-party model
  artifacts.
- [ ] No API keys, bearer tokens, private model endpoints, raw prompts, or
  private device-context payloads are present in docs, screenshots, logs, or
  release notes.
- [ ] `scripts/privacy_scan.sh` passes and its `privacy-scan.properties`
  artifact is attached.
- [ ] `privacy-scan.properties` records a machine-readable `reason` whenever
  high-confidence secret patterns are found.

## Build Verification

- [ ] `scripts/verify_local.sh` passes on a clean checkout.
- [ ] CI release operations evidence is complete: the `verify` job records
  `ci-local-verification`, the `emulator-regression` job records connected
  Android test evidence, `release-artifact-archive` uploads APK/AAB/mapping
  artifacts with SHA-256 values, and `protected-signing` runs in the protected
  signing environment with production signing evidence. All four evidence files
  are referenced from `docs/release_operations_record.json` with matching
  SHA-256 values.
- [ ] The GitHub Actions `emulator-regression` job has passed for the release
  candidate SHA, or the release ticket records why CI emulator execution was
  unavailable and links an equivalent local `scripts/regression_emulator.sh`
  report. The CI job must upload `android-emulator-regression-evidence` with
  `regression-emulator.properties`, nested emulator/device reports,
  instrumentation output, screenshot/UI/logcat artifacts, and the emulator log.
- [ ] `VERIFY_MODEL_URLS=1 scripts/verify_local.sh` is run when model URL
  availability/provenance needs fresh evidence. License readiness is still
  reviewed manually.
- [ ] `PERF_BASELINE_FILE=<rc perf-baseline.properties>
  scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` passes before release sign-off. Set
  `PUBLIC_RELEASE=1 EXPECTED_SIGNING_CERT_SHA256=<production upload cert>` when
  checking the public-distribution gate. The perf baseline must be from a
  non-emulator `arm64-v8a` device, match the current Gradle `versionName`, bind
  to the release artifact SHA-256, record non-zero measured timings, and use a
  non-future UTC `recordedAt` within the accepted freshness window. If
  `scripts/collect_perf_baseline.sh` fails, attach its `status=failed`
  collector report with `failedTarget`, `reason`, and verifier report linkage.
- [ ] `release-gate.properties` records `failedTarget` and `failedReason` for
  any failed gate run, so the release ticket can link the exact failing child
  report without guessing.
- [ ] `perf-baseline-verification.properties` records a machine-readable
  `reason` list whenever the perf baseline gate fails.
- [ ] Every `performanceSanity` item in `docs/release_validation_record.json`
  references a passed `perf-baseline-verification.properties` report generated
  by `scripts/verify_perf_baseline.sh`, with `target=perf-baseline`, a
  `performanceKey` that matches the record key, `missingFieldCount=0`, and a
  readable `baselineFile` plus matching `baselineSha256`. The verifier report
  must include non-empty `expectedArtifactSha256` and `expectedAppVersion`
  values, and the linked baseline must match those values, come from a
  non-emulator `arm64-v8a` device, record `oomOrAnrObserved=false`, and have a
  fresh UTC `recordedAt`; lightweight status-only, cross-key, or baseline-file
  swapped performance evidence files are not accepted.
- [ ] Release assembly and bundle tasks pass with release minification/resource
  shrinking enabled.
- [ ] ProGuard/R8 mapping files for the release candidate are archived with the
  artifact so crash stacks can be decoded. Attach
  `release-mapping.properties` from `scripts/verify_release_mapping.sh`; the
  `PUBLIC_RELEASE=1` gate requires this mapping check.

## Test Matrix

- [ ] `scripts/regression_emulator.sh` passes on a prepared arm64 AVD, or the
  release record explains why emulator validation was not applicable.
- [ ] `scripts/check_emulator_api_matrix.sh` is run before API matrix
  regression. Attach `emulator-api-matrix-readiness.properties`; if it fails,
  the report must list missing system-image APIs and missing AVD APIs instead
  of silently skipping matrix coverage.
- [ ] If API matrix readiness fails, run
  `scripts/prepare_emulator_api_matrix.sh` first in dry-run mode and attach its
  report. Only run `APPLY=1 scripts/prepare_emulator_api_matrix.sh` after
  explicitly approving the SDK package install and AVD creation list.
- [ ] Once API matrix AVDs are prepared,
  `scripts/regression_emulator_api_matrix.sh` passes for API 28/32/33/34/36.
  Attach the top-level `regression-emulator-api-matrix.properties` plus each
  nested API `regression-emulator.properties` report and matching SHA-256.
  Each nested report must have `status=passed`, `target=regression-emulator`,
  `exit_code=0`, empty `failedTarget`/`reason`, UTC start/finish fields,
  `clean_device=1`, matching API level, an ABI list containing `arm64-v8a`, a
  non-empty emulator serial and AVD name, source/expected/actual AndroidTest
  counts, and a readable instrumentation output whose final `OK` count matches
  `actual_android_test_count`. Each nested report must also link matching
  `emulator-verification.properties` and `device-verification.properties`
  reports from the same API run.
- [ ] `scripts/install_and_test_device.sh` passes on at least one physical
  arm64 device before a broad release candidate.
- [ ] Validation record includes device serial or AVD name, API level, ABI,
  `CLEAN_DEVICE` value, executed command, instrumentation result, and
  `instrumentation_test_count` from the verification report. Physical device
  reports must also include `exit_code=0`, empty `failedTarget`/`reason`, UTC
  start/finish fields, sufficient `data_free_kb`, and a readable
  `instrumentation_output_file` containing the final `OK` marker. The `OK`
  count must match `instrumentation_test_count`, and `debug_apk` /
  `android_test_apk` must match the project-approved debug APK paths. Emulator
  release records should link `regression-emulator.properties` plus the nested
  emulator/device reports, and each linked report must include a matching
  SHA-256 in `docs/release_validation_record.json`.
- [ ] Failed device, emulator, or regression reports include machine-readable
  `failedTarget` and `reason` fields plus any generated screenshot, window dump,
  logcat, or instrumentation evidence paths.
- [ ] Manual acceptance in `docs/phone_acceptance.md` is sampled for model
  setup, remote-mode privacy, tool confirmation, permissions, background
  reminders, sharing, and multimodal entry points.
- [ ] Manual acceptance records voice input, the Android system document picker,
  and MediaProjection consent separately from scripted regression; these
  system-mediated flows are not marked passed solely from scripts, mocked
  intents, or direct reader/ViewModel calls.
- [ ] Every manual acceptance, flow matrix, and performance sanity item in
  `docs/release_validation_record.json` records a structured evidence object
  with `status=passed`, a summary, an evidence file path that exists in the RC
  artifact bundle, matching `evidenceSha256`, owner, and non-future date; a
  bare string `passed` is not acceptable evidence.
- [ ] Every `manualAcceptance` evidence file is a formal manual acceptance
  report with `status=passed`, `target=manual-acceptance`, a `manualKey` that
  matches the record key, and `manualAcceptance=true`; lightweight status-only
  manual evidence files are not accepted.
- [ ] Manual acceptance evidence is generated from explicit owner sign-off, for
  example `OWNER="<reviewer>" MANUAL_ACCEPTANCE_ALL=1
  scripts/record_manual_acceptance_evidence.sh`; partial runs must remain
  failed until every required manual key is accepted.
- [ ] Every `flowMatrix` evidence file is a formal release flow report with
  `status=passed`, `target=release-flow`, a `flowKey` that matches the record
  key, and `releaseFlowPassed=true`; candidate-only or lightweight status-only
  flow evidence files are not accepted.
- [ ] `localModelDownloadVerification` release flow evidence must explicitly
  record local download verification, SHA-256 verification, storage preflight,
  failure recovery, unavailable download directory handling, SHA failure cleanup,
  insufficient-storage download failure, missing pending-download task recovery,
  remote fallback explanation, and lightweight alternative explanation.
  `customModelImportOrUrlRejection` evidence must explicitly record `.litertlm`
  import coverage, local non-`.litertlm` import rejection, import storage
  preflight, empty-file rejection, temp cleanup on copy failure, HTTPS-only
  custom download policy, non-`.litertlm` URL rejection, invalid/credentialed URL
  rejection, and successful local import registration as `UnverifiedCustom`.
- [ ] `shareAndPickerInput` release flow evidence must explicitly record
  ACTION_SEND text staging, remote-mode text-share protection, remote vision
  image attachment staging, unsupported-vision protection, no implicit image
  OCR, bounded document excerpts, and picker attachment prompting.
- [ ] `privacyAndDataControls` release flow evidence must explicitly record
  the App privacy notice entry, long-term memory clear and forget controls,
  current-session deletion, remote configuration clearing, and deletion/control
  copy visible to the user.
- [ ] `voiceInput` release flow evidence must explicitly record the near-field
  voice disclosure, one-shot transcript draft with no auto-send, microphone
  permission failure/recovery behavior, and voice-capture cancellation.
  PocketMind behavior after microphone denial/grant recovery must be verified;
  Android system permission dialog copy and button interaction are manual/device
  acceptance evidence, not a required Compose AndroidTest gate.
- [ ] `adaptiveUi` release flow evidence must explicitly record large-font
  reachability, landscape reachability, and accessible labels/actions for core
  controls.
- [ ] Release flow evidence is generated from explicit owner sign-off, for
  example `OWNER="<reviewer>" RELEASE_FLOW_ALL=1
  scripts/record_release_flow_evidence.sh`; partial runs must remain failed
  until every required release flow is accepted.
- [ ] Remote model manual acceptance samples both a single public evidence
  tool request and a multi-evidence question such as two-location comparison;
  mixed private/action tool batches must fail closed before execution.
- [ ] `scripts/live_remote_emulator.sh` defaults to emulator validation and only
  accepts a physical serial when `POCKETMIND_LIVE_REMOTE_TARGET=device` is set.
  It reports `failedTarget` and `reason` for missing configuration,
  emulator/device selection, install/configuration, remote request, and
  expected-response failures, and links screenshot, UI dump, and logcat
  evidence paths without persisting API keys.
- [ ] Matrix covers at least: API 28 minimum behavior, API 32 legacy storage
  permission behavior, API 33 media/notification permissions, API 34 selected
  visual media access, API 36 target behavior, and one physical arm64 device
  with realistic LiteRT-LM CPU/GPU fallback. Each API matrix row must include
  a nested per-API regression evidence file path that exists in the RC
  validation artifact bundle and a matching `evidenceSha256`; lightweight
  status-only evidence files are not accepted.
- [ ] Matrix covers first install, upgrade install, local model download and
  verification, custom model import or custom URL rejection path, remote model
  HTTPS configuration, encrypted API key clear, session persistence, memory
  controls, privacy/data controls, reminders after reboot, share/picker input,
  voice input, Accessibility text, recent media OCR, and MediaProjection
  cancellation.
  Candidate evidence files marked `candidateOnly=true`,
  `releaseFlowPassed=false`, or `target=release-flow-matrix-candidate-evidence`
  are reviewer input only and must not be referenced as passed flow evidence in
  `docs/release_validation_record.json`.
- [ ] Performance sanity is recorded for first launch, model load, first token,
  streaming stop/cancel, background reminder delivery, and memory pressure on
  the largest recommended model expected for the channel. Each record must point
  to the perf baseline verifier report, not a hand-written summary.
- [ ] `docs/release_validation_record.json` is updated and approved, then
  `VERIFY_RELEASE_VALIDATION=1 scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` passes. The gate
  checks emulator regression, rejects `emulator-*` serials as physical-device
  instrumentation evidence, verifies API matrix coverage, manual acceptance,
  system-mediated flows, remote public evidence samples, mixed-batch rejection,
  sanitized screenshots with matching SHA-256, flow coverage, and performance
  sanity evidence.

## Crash, ANR, And Monitoring

- [ ] Monitoring owner and signal source are named. For Play-distributed builds,
  Android Vitals in Play Console is the minimum source; if a crash SDK is added
  later, its privacy disclosure and opt-in/retention behavior must be reviewed
  before release.
- [ ] Release candidate has a crash/ANR smoke window on internal or closed
  testing with no unresolved launch crash, install crash, crash loop, fatal
  native LiteRT-LM failure, or reproducible ANR. The smoke window evidence file
  path and SHA-256 are recorded in `docs/release_operations_record.json`. Use
  `scripts/collect_crash_anr_smoke_evidence.sh` with the device verification
  report, instrumentation output, and captured `adb logcat` to generate this
  evidence. The operations gate parses the smoke report and requires
  `status=passed`, analyzed logcat, all crash/ANR/LiteRT counters at 0, all
  five `no*` booleans true, and matching SHA-256/size values for the nested
  device report, instrumentation output, and logcat files.
- [ ] Manual validation captures `adb logcat`, tombstone/native crash evidence,
  and ANR traces for any failure; release notes link the issue or state that no
  crash/ANR was observed in the RC window.
- [ ] Crash-free and ANR thresholds for staged rollout are written in the
  release record, with a named person watching the first 24 hours after each
  rollout step. Monitoring setup and rollback plan evidence files are recorded
  with SHA-256 values so release operations approval cannot rely only on prose.
- [ ] `docs/release_operations_record.json` is updated and approved, then
  `VERIFY_RELEASE_OPERATIONS=1 scripts/verify_release_gate.sh` passes. The gate
  checks CI local verification, connected Android tests, release artifact
  archive evidence, protected production signing evidence, Android Vitals
  coverage, crash/ANR smoke status, rollout watcher, rollout thresholds,
  monitoring evidence, crash/ANR smoke evidence, rollback evidence, previous
  known-good metadata or initial-release exemption, rollback criteria, Play
  version-code policy, model manifest rollback path, and data compatibility
  notes.

## Rollback

- [ ] Previous known-good APK/AAB, version code, commit SHA, and release notes
  are available.
- [ ] Rollback owner and decision channel are named.
- [ ] Rollback criteria are defined, including install failure, crash loop,
  model download verification failure, privacy boundary failure, or critical
  tool execution regression.
- [ ] For staged Play rollout, the immediate first action is documented: halt
  rollout, keep collecting Android Vitals/user reports, and decide whether to
  resume, replace, or ship a fixed build.
- [ ] If production has already advanced past the prior artifact, the rollback
  plan uses a new artifact with a higher `versionCode`; Play cannot roll users
  back to a lower version code as an ordinary update.
- [ ] Model download manifest changes can be reverted without requiring an APK
  code change when the release process supports remote metadata updates; if not,
  the required APK rollback path is documented.
- [ ] User data compatibility is reviewed: Room migrations are forward-only, so
  downgrades must be tested or explicitly unsupported.

## Final Gate

- [ ] Release readiness remaining items are either complete or accepted by the
  release owner with a dated risk note.
- [ ] The release artifact, checksums, test logs, privacy/license review, and
  screenshots are attached to the release record.
- [ ] The release owner signs off.

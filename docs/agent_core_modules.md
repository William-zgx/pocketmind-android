# PocketMind Agent Core Modules

This document is the module map for the end-side Agent architecture. It records
what each core module owns, what it must not own, and the current implementation
status.

## Tool Layer

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/tool/`
- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/action/ActionExecutor.kt`

Responsibilities:

- Declare every device capability as a `ToolSpec`.
- Validate `ToolRequest` names and arguments before execution.
- Declare permissions, risk level, and confirmation policy.
- Return structured `ToolResult` values with `ToolError` codes.

Non-responsibilities:

- Tool code must not decide conversation flow.
- Tool code must not bypass user confirmation for medium or higher risk work.

Current status:

- Implemented registry, JSON schema strings, argument validation, permission
  declarations, risk levels, confirmation policy, structured result helpers,
  and Android Intent execution results.
- Tool argument validation is now driven by each tool's JSON schema for
  required properties, closed argument sets, argument types, enum constraints,
  numeric min/max bounds, and regex `pattern` checks.
- Current tools cover Wi-Fi settings, flashlight settings, map search, web
  search, email draft, calendar draft, contact draft, local reminders,
  confirmed clipboard text reads, outbound system sharing for text, and
  external deep-link/open URL navigation.
- Tools that may require runtime permissions declare that requirement in
  `ToolSpec`. The reminder confirmation path requests notification permission
  before execution when Android requires it.

Tests:

- `ToolRegistryTest`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.confirmedToolResultIsObservedAndCompletesRun`

## Agent Loop

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/orchestration/`

Responsibilities:

- Own the run state machine.
- Load local memory context.
- Plan chat, tool, or skill-backed tool work.
- Request user confirmation before tool execution.
- Observe `ToolResult` values after execution and append trace steps.

Non-responsibilities:

- The loop does not start Android activities directly.
- The loop does not store secret or full remote error payloads in trace.

Current status:

- Implemented single-run planning for chat and tool requests.
- Implemented confirmation state and post-confirmation observation.
- Confirmed clipboard observations can now create a follow-up model prompt so
  the assistant can answer from the just-read tool result instead of stopping at
  a generic "tool succeeded" message.
- Action routing now depends on installed capabilities: when user input is judged
  as an action and `ModelCapability.MobileAction` is unavailable, the loop
  returns `MissingModel` rather than planning a tool step.
- Non-clipboard tools can also request a model continuation via
  `ToolResult.data["modelPrompt"]`, enabling a generic tool-to-model handoff.
- `clipboard_summary_share_skill` now has a constrained app-level continuation:
  after the confirmed clipboard read and local model summary, the loop binds the
  model output into a `share_text` request and returns to
  `AwaitingUserConfirmation`. It does not execute the share step directly.
- Skill-driven continuation now also supports mixed tool/model step chains and
  enforces a bounded step budget across explicit replans and skill continuations.
- Retryable tool failures now schedule one bounded retry on the already
  confirmed request, record a `ToolRetryScheduled` trace/audit event, and only
  fail the run after the retry budget is exhausted.
- Enforce a per-run tool-step ceiling (`maxToolStepsPerRun`) to prevent
  infinite planner/skill continuation loops; hitting the ceiling now moves the run
  to `Failed` with a `Failed` trace step and tool rejection summary.
- Tool observation now produces an explicit `AgentObservationDecision`:
  complete, continue with model, retry tool, fail, or cancel. The decision is
  recorded in trace without storing private continuation prompts.
- Successful observations can now call `AgentObservationReplanner` to produce a
  next tool plan. The default production strategy is conservative: it only
  replans one explicit next action after sequence words such as "然后" / "then",
  and only when the current run has planned exactly one tool so far.
- Replanned tools are validated, safety checked, audited, traced, and returned
  to `AwaitingUserConfirmation` instead of being executed directly.
- Confirmation and observation are now bound to the current pending/confirmed
  request id, so stale request ids from earlier steps cannot advance the run.
- Implemented trace steps for skill planning, user confirmation, tool
  observation, assistant response, rejection, cancellation, and failure.
- General model-driven next-step planning, generalized skill continuation orchestration,
  and persisted run recovery are now implemented with bounded safety checks.

Tests:

- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest`
- `AssistantOrchestratorTest`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeCompatibilityTest`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.successfulObservationCanPlanNextToolAndRequestConfirmationAgain`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.replannedToolCannotReuseExistingRequestId`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.clipboardSummarySharePlansShareAfterLocalModelResult`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.compositeSkillIgnoresOldRequestIdsAfterShareIsPendingOrExecuting`
- `AssistantOrchestratorTest.defaultSequentialReplannerPlansExplicitNextActionAfterObservation`
- `AssistantOrchestratorTest.clipboardSummaryShareAdvancesFromModelOutputToShareConfirmation`

## Skill Framework

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/skill/`

Responsibilities:

- Declare reusable, versioned task skills.
- Map skill steps to Tool Registry requests.
- Keep task composition separate from Android execution.

Non-responsibilities:

- Skills must not call `Context.startActivity`.
- Skills must not define private tool names outside the registry.

Current status:

- Implemented `SkillManifest`, `SkillRequest`, `SkillPlan`, `SkillStep`, and
  `SkillRuntime`.
- Implemented built-in manifests for email drafts, calendar drafts, map search,
  information lookup, device settings, background reminders, clipboard context,
  system text sharing, and external deep-link navigation.
- Implemented a minimal declarative composition model for ordered skill steps:
  tool steps can declare stable ids, dependencies, and argument bindings; model
  transform steps can consume prior tool outputs and expose named outputs.
- Added `clipboard_summary_share_skill` as the first composite skill contract:
  it reads clipboard text after confirmation, keeps the transform local, then
  binds the generated summary into the system share tool.
- This composite skill is now wired into the app loop for one conservative
  flow: read clipboard, summarize locally, request explicit confirmation for
  the share sheet. Other composite skills still need their own UI orchestration.
- Added `deep_link_navigation_skill` to map deep-link tool calls into a single-step
  skill with external-navigation capability.
- Added `SkillRunExecutor` as the first executable multi-step skill runner. It
  validates the plan, resolves step output bindings, enforces a step limit, and
  separates private binding outputs from the public result/trace.
- `SkillRunExecutor` now gates every tool step through registry validation and
  safety policy before execution. Steps that require user confirmation return
  `AwaitingConfirmation` instead of calling the injected `ToolExecutor`
  directly.
- General app-level UI orchestration for arbitrary multi-confirmation skill
  runs, richer skill cancellation state, and persisted skill runs are still
  pending.

Tests:

- `BuiltInSkillRuntimeTest`
- `BuiltInSkillRuntimeTest.plansClipboardSummaryShareAsOrderedCompositeSkill`
- `BuiltInSkillRuntimeTest.routesClipboardSummaryShareInputToCompositePlan`
- `BuiltInSkillRuntimeTest.validateStructureRejectsUnorderedOrInvalidCompositePlan`
- `SkillRunExecutorTest`
- `ToolSchemaContractTest`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.wifiActionInputRequestsConfirmationBeforeExecution`

## Device Context

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/device/`
- Current context sources: `MemoryRepository`, `SessionRepository`, model and
  device capability state in `ChatUiState`.

Responsibilities:

- Provide controlled, minimal context to the loop and planner.
- Keep private device data out of remote prompts unless explicitly allowed.

Current status:

- Implemented local memory hits, recent session history, and a minimal
  `DeviceContextSnapshot` containing non-secret state such as inference mode,
  installed capability classes, memory toggle, storage estimate, active-session
  presence, and pending confirmation state.
- The Agent loop records this context in trace and may include it in the model
  prompt behind an instruction to use it only when relevant.
- Device context now also carries notification-posting capability from Android's
  runtime notification policy so reminder and notification-heavy flows can avoid
  claiming success when user notification delivery is unavailable.
- Implemented a confirmed `read_clipboard` tool for current foreground text
  clipboard access. Raw text is used only to build the immediate in-memory
  continuation prompt after user confirmation; trace steps, audit events, and
  persisted tool-observation messages store sanitized summaries instead of the
  raw text.
- Remote model mode does not automatically receive clipboard continuation
  prompts; it asks the user to switch local or manually provide text they agree
  to upload.
- Remote model mode also strips memory hits and device context from ordinary
  chat prompts. Android share-intent text and attachment metadata are held back
  from automatic remote generation unless the user manually provides the content
  they are willing to upload.
- Chat history now carries `MessagePrivacy`; messages marked `LocalOnly` are
  persisted for the local conversation but are filtered from remote history, and
  a `LocalOnly` current prompt is rejected before any remote request is made.
- ViewModel dependencies now sit behind narrow ports for model state, sessions,
  generation settings, remote settings, downloads, memory, tool execution, and
  assistant routing so privacy behavior can be regression-tested without
  Android-bound concrete repositories.
- Screen understanding, current app, notification readers, files, and calendar
  readers are still pending.

## Execution Boundary

Code:

- `ActionExecutor`
- `PendingAgentConfirmation`
- `PocketMindViewModel.confirmAgentConfirmation`

Responsibilities:

- Convert confirmed `ToolRequest` values into Android system intents.
- Return execution success or failure as `ToolResult`.
- Surface execution results to the UI and Agent trace.

Current status:

- Implemented Intent-based draft/navigation execution, AlarmManager-backed
  reminder scheduling, and observation.
- User cancellation of a pending tool request now closes the run as
  `Cancelled` and records trace/audit events without executing Android intents.
- Implemented runtime notification permission request for reminder confirmation
  and Android share-target ingestion for text/images/audio/video/PDF metadata.
- Implemented outbound `share_text` as a confirmed tool that opens Android's
  system share panel. Success means the chooser was opened; the app cannot know
  whether the user completed sharing in the destination app.
- Deep links are now implemented via the new `open_deep_link` tool and can route
  to web URLs and supported URI schemes as a confirmed navigation action.
- App-specific intent mediation, broader permission flows, and
  result-confirmation callbacks are still pending.

## Safety And Audit

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/safety/`
- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/audit/`
- `ToolSpec.riskLevel`
- `ToolSpec.confirmationPolicy`
- `ToolSpec.permissions`
- `AgentTraceStore`
- `tool_audit_events` Room table

Responsibilities:

- Make capability risk explicit in code.
- Keep a trace of planned and executed work.
- Minimize stored private data.

Current status:

- Implemented risk and permission declarations, `SafetyPolicy`, in-memory run
  trace, and persistent audit events for tool planning, confirmation request,
  user confirmation, user cancellation, rejection, and observation.
- Audit events store request metadata, status, risk, permission names, and a
  short sanitized summary. They intentionally do not store tool arguments,
  prompts, remote responses, or secrets.
- Audit summary sanitization removes key-like tokens, bearer credentials, and
  email addresses before truncation. The in-memory audit sink stores the same
  redacted copy as the Room-backed repository so tests cannot accidentally
  depend on raw private data.
- The first local-only privacy boundary is implemented for shared input,
  clipboard-derived continuations, and remote chat history. Broader taint
  propagation, undo/rollback, and richer per-tool privacy policies are pending.

Tests:

- `SafetyPolicyTest`
- `ToolAuditEventTest`
- `SessionRepositoryTest`
- `AgentLoopRuntimeTest.confirmedToolResultIsObservedAndCompletesRun`

## Memory

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/memory/`
- `memory_records` Room table

Responsibilities:

- Recall relevant local context when memory is enabled.
- Avoid injecting unrelated private content.
- Persist explicit user preferences and task-state records until the user
  forgets or clears them.

Current status:

- Implemented lightweight token/hash memory over saved sessions.
- Added explicit long-term memory controls for preference records, task-state
  records, forgetting individual records, and clearing the index.
- Explicit preference and task-state records are now persisted in Room and
  reloaded during memory rebuild; ordinary conversation-derived memory remains
  rebuilt from saved chat messages instead of duplicated into the memory table.
- `rebuild` extracts simple explicit user preference statements such as
  `记住：...` / `remember ...`.
- Dedicated embedding-model semantic memory and UI controls for reviewing or
  forgetting saved records are pending.

Tests:

- `MemoryRepositoryTest`

## Background Tasks

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/background/`
- `scheduled_tasks` Room table
- `ReminderAlarmReceiver`

Responsibilities:

- Persist scheduled Agent tasks before handing them to Android.
- Use Android system scheduling instead of keeping foreground coroutines alive.
- Deliver reminder notifications through a dedicated notification channel.
- Keep background task scheduling separate from conversation planning.

Current status:

- Implemented `schedule_reminder` as a confirmed tool and `reminder_skill` as a
  built-in one-step skill.
- Implemented `ScheduledTaskRepository`, `AndroidBackgroundTaskScheduler`, a
  reminder notification channel, `ReminderAlarmReceiver`, and
  `ReminderBootReceiver`.
- The scheduler uses `AlarmManager.setAndAllowWhileIdle`; triggered reminders
  post a local notification when notification permission is available and update
  the task status to `Delivered` or `Failed`.
- `ReminderBootReceiver` listens for `BOOT_COMPLETED` and asks
  `ReminderRescheduler` to restore every still-`Scheduled` reminder after the
  system clears alarms on reboot. Past-due reminders are rescheduled with a
  short catch-up delay instead of being silently dropped.
- If an alarm cannot be scheduled or restored, the task is marked `Failed` so
  repository state does not claim a reminder is still pending when Android has
  no alarm registered.
- Reminder confirmation requests notification permission before execution on
  Android versions that require it. If permission is still unavailable,
  execution fails with a structured `PermissionDenied` tool result.
- Periodic check policies和 WorkManager 周期任务已接入应用启动：
  启动时会补齐未生效提醒并确保周期检查任务处于运行状态（去重更新）。
- 周期检查 Worker 仅执行本地扫描与告警，不联网、不触发模型、不发外部 intent。
- 运行时任务面板已接入：任务列表可展示周期检查与提醒任务，并支持刷新；周期检查策略字段已解析并展示，限流策略说明仍可继续细化。

Tests:

- `ScheduledTaskRepositoryTest`
- `ActionExecutorTest`
- `ActionPlannerTest.infersReminderDraftWithDelayMinutes`
- `ToolRegistryTest.validatesReminderDelayMinutesAsPositiveInteger`
- `BuiltInSkillRuntimeTest.plansReminderAsBackgroundToolStep`

## Multimodal Inputs

Code:

- `app/src/main/java/com/bytedance/zgx/pocketmind/multimodal/`
- `MainActivity` share intent handling

Responsibilities:

- Accept user-initiated shared text and attachment metadata from Android.
- Classify attachments by MIME type without reading file content by default.
- Keep multimodal source handling separate from chat generation and tools.

Current status:

- Implemented Android share-target entry for `ACTION_SEND` and
  `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE`.
- Implemented privacy-minimal `SharedInput` prompts for text plus attachment
  metadata such as kind, MIME type, display name, and byte size.
- Shared-input prompts are marked `LocalOnly` when generated automatically, so
  local processing can continue without later leaking the prompt or local
  assistant response into remote chat history.
- The app does not read image, audio, video, PDF, or document bytes yet; it only
  records metadata in the user-visible prompt. Voice capture, screenshot
  capture, gallery picker, OCR, image understanding, and document parsing are
  pending.

Tests:

- `SharedInputTest`
- `PocketMindViewModelTest.localSharedInputDoesNotEnterLaterRemoteHistory`
- `PocketMindViewModelTest.remoteModeRejectsLocalOnlyPromptBeforeCallingRemoteRuntime`

## Regression Strategy

Local verification:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Emulator regression:

```bash
adb devices
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Full device validation remains required for LiteRT-LM model execution because
emulators usually do not expose the same GPU backend behavior as physical
arm64-v8a devices.
